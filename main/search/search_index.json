Defining a reference system A reference system is defined by: A platform is defined by: Hardware (e.g. an off-the-shelf single-board computer, embedded ECU, etc.) if there are multiple configurations available for such hardware, ensure it is specified Operating System (OS) like RT Linux, QNX, etc. along with any special configurations made for simplicity and ease of benchmarking, all nodes must run on a single process a fixed number of nodes each node with: a fixed number of publishers and subscribers a fixed processing time or a fixed publishing rate a fixed message type of fixed size to be used for every node With these defined attributes the reference system can be replicated across many different possible configurations to be used to benchmark each configuration against the other in a reliable and fair manner. With this approach portable and repeatable tests can also be defined to reliably confirm if a given reference system meets the requirements. Supported Platforms To enable as many people as possible to replicate this reference system, the platform(s) were chosen to be easily accessible (inexpensive, high volume), have lots of documentation, large community use and will be supported well into the future. Platforms were not chosen for performance of the reference system - we know we could run \u201cfaster\u201d with a more powerful CPU or GPU but then it would be harder for others to validate findings and test their own configurations. Accessibility is the key here and will be considered if more platforms want to be added to this benchmark list.

Base node types Most real-world systems can be boiled down to only a handful of base node \"types\" that are then repeated to make the real-world system. This does not cover all possible node types, however it allows for numerous complicated systems to be developed using the same base building blocks.

The example simulates a real world scenario, Autoware.Auto and its LiDAR data pipeline, that can be used to evaluate the performance of the executor. To this end, the example comes with built-in performance measurements that make it easy to compare the performance between executor implementations in a repeatable way. Quick Start Some tools are provided in order to automate and standardize the report generation process for this autoware_reference_system . First, install and build the dependencies (ade) $ python3 -m pip install psrecord bokeh # optional dependency: networkx (ade) $ cd workspace (ade) $ colcon build --packages-up-to autoware_reference_system The easiest way to run the benchmarks is through the ctest interface. Rebuild the package with the RUN_BENCHMARK option and run colcon test : (ade) $ colcon build --packages-select autoware_reference_system \\ --cmake-force-configure --cmake-args -DRUN_BENCHMARK=ON (ade) $ colcon test --packages-select autoware_reference_system After the tests have run, reports can be found as .html files in $ROS_HOME/benchmark_autoware_reference_system/<timestamp> ( $ROS_HOME defaults to ~/.ros ). The symlink $ROS_HOME/benchmark_autoware_reference_system/latest always points to the latest results. Detailed reports to individual test runs can be found in subdirectories of the form <duration>/<middleware>/<executable> . More details on all the supported CMake arguments can be found in the supported CMake argument section below. By default the tests uses the default ROS 2 middleware set for the system. To run the tests for all available RMWs, add the -DALL_RMWS=ON CMake argument to the colcon build step. The test duration can be configured through the RUN_TIMES variable in CMakelists.txt . A separate set of tests is created for each chosen runtime. Test Results and Reports Reports are automatically generated depending on which tests are run. The main test directory ( $ROS_HOME/benchmark_autoware_reference_system/latest by default) contains the summary reports , which aggregate metrics across all tested configurations. Below this main test directory, each tested configuration has a subdirectory of the form <duration>/<middleware>/<executable name> . This directory contains the raw trace data and additional per-test reports in .html format. Tweaking the benchmark setup To get more fine-grained control over the benchmarking process invoke the benchmark script directly. To get a summary of the available options, call (ade) $ $(ros2 pkg prefix --share autoware_reference_system)/scripts/benchmark.py --help As an example, to run all benchmarks starting with autoware_ and the autoware_default_multithreaded benchmark for 15 seconds run (ade) $ $(ros2 pkg prefix --share autoware_reference_system)/scripts/benchmark.py \\ 15 'autoware_*' The --logdir option can be used to store the measurement results and reports in a custom directory, without adding a timestamp. Note that this may overwrite existing measurement results in the same directory. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) The performance measurement evaluates the executor using the following metrics. In general, the lowest value within each KPI is considered to be the better performance. CPU utilization In general a lower CPU utilization is better since it enables you to choose a smaller CPU or have more functionality on a larger CPU for other things. Memory utilization In general a lower memory utilization is better since it enables you to choose a smaller memory or have more space for other things Number of dropped sensor samples in transform nodes The nodes in the reference system always use the most recent sensor data (i.e., use a history depth of 1) This is a common strategy in real-world settings, as old sensor data is much less valuable than new sensor data For example an image from 30 seconds ago is much less helpful while driving down the road than an image from 0.1 second ago Fusion nodes drop messages during normal operation if the inputs publish with different frequencies In transform nodes, however, dropped messages indicate that the transform node cannot keep up with its input Number of front LiDAR samples that did not trigger an update in the Object Collision Estimator The Front and Rear LiDARs have the same publishing frequency This means Object Collision Estimator should run for every LiDAR sample Count number of executions of Object Collision Estimator and Front LiDAR and report any difference Worst-case Latency between Front LiDAR and the Object Collision Estimator For worst-case latency we want to identify obstacles in time (i.e. early enough that we can still emergency-brake). Average Latency between Front LiDAR and Object Collision Estimator For average latency we want to identify obstacles as soon as possible so we can account for the obstacle in our planning. The Behavior Planner should be as cyclical as possible The desired behavior of the Behavior Planner is to be as cyclical as possible, meaning it should be executed as close to its set frequency of 100ms as possible Measure the jitter and drift over time of the timer callback Message Types A single message type is used for the entire reference system when generating results in order to simplify the setup as well as make it more repeatable and extensible. This means only one message type from the list below is used during any given experimental run for every node in the reference system. Message4kB reference message with a fixed size of 4 kilobytes (kB) Other messages with different fixed sizes could be added here in the future. When reporting results it is important to specify the message type used during the experiment, as the message size impacts the metrics. Autoware Reference System Built from a handful of building-block node types , each one of these nodes are meant to simulate a real-world node from the Autoware.Auto project LiDAR data pipeline. Under each node type are the requirements used for this specific reference system, autoware_reference_system . Future reference systems could have slightly different requirements and still use the same building-block node types. For simplicity, every node except for the command nodes only publishes one topic, and this topic has the same name as the node that publishes it. However, each topic can be subscribed to by multiple different nodes. Also for simplicity, every node that does processing (aka number crunching) by default is configured to do that processing for the same amount of time: roughly 10 milliseconds. This processing time varies drastically depending on what platform you are on since each node does a fixed amount of actual work, not a fixed amount of time. See the Configuring Processing Time section for more details. Message Type all nodes use the same message type during any single test run default message type: Message4kB to be implemented: Message64kB Message256kB Message512kB Message1024kB Message5120kB Sensor Nodes all sensor node have a publishing rate (cycle time) of 100 milliseconds all sensor nodes publish the same message type total of 5 sensor nodes : Front LiDAR Driver Rear LiDAR Driver Point Cloud Map Visualizer Lanelet2Map Transform Nodes all transform nodes have one subscriber and one publisher all transform nodes start processing after a message is received publishes message after processing is complete total of 10 transform nodes: Front Points Transformer Rear Points Transformer Voxel Grid Downsampler Point Cloud Map Loader Ray Ground Filter Object Collision Estimator MPC Controller Parking Planner Lane Planner Fusion Nodes all fusion nodes have two subscribers and one publisher for this reference system all fusion nodes start processing after a message is received from all subscriptions all fusion nodes have a max input time difference between the first input received and last input received before publishing of 9999 seconds publishes message after processing is complete total of 5 fusion nodes: Point Cloud Fusion NDT Localizer Vehicle Interface Lanelet2 Global Planner Lanelet 2 Map Loader Cyclic Nodes for this reference system there is only 1 cyclic node this cyclic node has 6 subscribers and one publisher this cyclic node starts processing after a message is received from any single subscription publishes message after processing is complete Command Nodes all command nodes have 1 subscriber and zero publishers all command nodes prints out the final latency statistics after a message is received on the specified topic total of 2 command nodes: VehicleDBWSystem IntersectionOutput Intersection Nodes for this reference system there is only EuclideanClusterDetector this intersection node has 2 subscribers and 2 publishers publishes message after processing is complete on the correspoding publisher Configure Processing Time Many nodes in the reference system are actually performing some pseudo-work by finding prime numbers up until some maximum value. Depending on the platform, this maximum value will need to be changed so that these nodes do not take an absurd amount of time. This maximum value should be chosen on a platform-by-platform basis so that the total run time of this work takes some desired length of time. In order to make finding this maximum value a bit easier across many different platforms a simple number_cruncher_benchmark is provided that will loop over various maximum values and spit out how long each one takes to run. After running this executable on your platform you should have a good idea what maximum value you should use in your timing configuration so that each node does some measurable work for some desired amount of time. Here is an example output of the number_cruncher_benchmark run on a typical development platform (Intel 9i7): ros2 run autoware_reference_system number_cruncher_benchmark maximum_number run time 64 0.001609ms 128 0.002896ms 256 0.006614ms 512 0.035036ms 1024 0.050957ms 2048 0.092732ms 4096 0.22837ms 8192 0.566779ms 16384 1.48837ms 32768 3.64588ms 65536 9.6687ms 131072 24.1154ms 262144 62.3475ms 524288 162.762ms 1048576 429.882ms 2097152 1149.79ms Run the above command on your system, select your desired run_time and place the corresponding maximum_number in the timing configuration file for the desired nodes. Supported CMake Arguments RUN_BENCHMARK Tell CMake to build the benchmark tests that will check the reference system against its requirements before running a sweep of tests to generate trace files and reports Without the RUN_BENCHMARK variable set to ON only the standard linter tests will be run TEST_PLATFORM Test CMake to build the tests to check if the tests are being run from a supported platform or not This flag can be omitted if you would like to run the tests on a development system before running them on a supported platform The platform tests themselves can and should be improved going forward and are only some simple checks today (architecture, number of CPUs, PREEMPT_RT flag, etc.) Set this to ON to check if the current platform is supported SKIP_TRACING Set to ON to skip the ros2_tracing tests, aka the callback tests This can greatly reduce the length of time the colcon test command takes to run ALL_RMWS Set this to ON if you'd like to run tests on all available RMWs as well Otherwise use only default RMW (first one listed by CMake function get_available_rmw_implementations ) Defaults to OFF Generating Node Graph Image To generate the image shown above you can take advantage of a program called graphviz that has a command line interface (CLI) command dot . First, check out the provided .dot file to get an idea of how the dot syntax works (feel free to modify it for your use case or future reference systems ). To generate the .dot file into an .svg image, run the following command: dot -Tsvg autoware_reference_system.dot Note: you can change the generated image type to any of the supported type parameters if you would like a different filetype. Available benchmarks The package comes with a set of benchmark executables. Many of these benchmarks distinguish hotpath nodes from other nodes; these are the nodes involved in the latency KPI, starting with the front/rear LiDAR and ending in the ObjectCollisionEstimator. Within the hotpath nodes, the benchmarks further distinguish between front/rear LiDAR nodes (the LidarDriver and PointsTransformer in front/rear, respectively) and the fusion chain nodes (everything from PointCloudFusion to ObjectCollisionEstimator). Some benchmarks use real-time priorities and affinities. In this case, hotpath nodes run at priority 1 on cores 1-3; the planner nodes runs at priority 30 on core 0; and all other nodes run without real-time priority on all cores. ROS 2 benchmarks autoware_default_singlethreaded : All nodes are assigned to the same single-threaded ROS executor autoware_default_multithreaded : All nodes are assigned to the same multi-threaded ROS executor autoware_default_staticsinglethreaded : Like autoware_default_singlethreaded , but using the StaticSingleThreadedExecutor . autoware_default_prioritized : Separate executors for front LiDAR nodes, rear LiDAR nodes fusion chain nodes, behavior planner, and everything else.

Defining a reference system A reference system is defined by: A platform is defined by: Hardware (e.g. an off-the-shelf single-board computer, embedded ECU, etc.) if there are multiple configurations available for such hardware, ensure it is specified Operating System (OS) like RT Linux, QNX, etc. along with any special configurations made for simplicity and ease of benchmarking, all nodes must run on a single process a fixed number of nodes each node with: a fixed number of publishers and subscribers a fixed processing time or a fixed publishing rate a fixed message type of fixed size to be used for every node With these defined attributes the reference system can be replicated across many different possible configurations to be used to benchmark each configuration against the other in a reliable and fair manner. With this approach portable and repeatable tests can also be defined to reliably confirm if a given reference system meets the requirements. Supported Platforms To enable as many people as possible to replicate this reference system, the platform(s) were chosen to be easily accessible (inexpensive, high volume), have lots of documentation, large community use and will be supported well into the future. Platforms were not chosen for performance of the reference system - we know we could run \u201cfaster\u201d with a more powerful CPU or GPU but then it would be harder for others to validate findings and test their own configurations. Accessibility is the key here and will be considered if more platforms want to be added to this benchmark list.

Base node types Most real-world systems can be boiled down to only a handful of base node \"types\" that are then repeated to make the real-world system.
